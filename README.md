# MicroBit-FunScripts

## Purpose of this repository
Here are some samples of code I wrote to play with the BBC Micro:Bit and learn how to code it. A lot of it is taken from the official samples that can be found on the Micro:Bit website, but I've stitched them together and written a menu system.

## How to use
Take any of one of these Python files and flash it to the Micro:Bit using the online tool or the Mu editor. The script should begin working as soon as the flash is finished.

## Explanation of super_selector_script
The super_selector_script is my attempt to build a menu system for the Micro:Bit so that each small programme within it behaves like a standalone app. My intention was to keep adding more and more functions to it, like you would a smartphone. However, it ceased working at a certain number of lines, so I think I was running into a memory constraint. To use this script, use the A button to toggle through a series of options. Each aption represents an "app". When you are happy with the selection, push the B button and the app will start to play. If you want to stop an app and go back to the menu, push the reset button on the back of the Micro:Bit. 

## Explanation of other scripts
The other scripts are standalone and do not form part of the super_selector_script menu system.
